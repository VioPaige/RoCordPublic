public code for rocord


Welcome to the public code repository of rocord, feel free to use and customise the code to your own needs! (especially the localscript lua will need to be modified as its made to fit my specific gui system).


localscript.lua - script for in a localscript in starterplayerscripts
serverscript.lua - script for in a serverscript in serverscriptservice
button.lua - script to toggle between channels, put this in your channel button presets
posting.lua - script for posting messages from roblox
backend.js - script to be hosted with web hosting on your custom domain (you will need to edit the link in serverscript.lua to this)
