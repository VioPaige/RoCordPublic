public code for rocord


Welcome to the public code repository of rocord, feel free to use and customise the code to your own needs! (especially the localscript lua will need to be modified as its made to fit my specific gui system).\n\n


localscript.lua - script for in a localscript in starterplayerscripts\n
serverscript.lua - script for in a serverscript in serverscriptservice\n
button.lua - script to toggle between channels, put this in your channel button presets\n
posting.lua - script for posting messages from roblox\n
backend.js - script to be hosted with web hosting on your custom domain (you will need to edit the link in serverscript.lua to this)\n
rocord.rblx - the full place including the basic gui prepared for the system\n
